        And it is addressed to "<recipient>"
        And the subject contains "<subject>"
        And a sample text is entered in the body
            """
            Hello, this email contains an image.

            Regards,
            Sender
            """
        And we attached "<image>" to the email
        When we send the email
        Then "<recipient>" should receive the email with subject "<subject>"
        And it should be from the Sender
        And the body should match the sample text
        And the attachment/s should match "<image>"
